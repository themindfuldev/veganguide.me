**Can dogs be vegan?**

Yes, dogs are omnivores, not carnivores. They have adapted to digest starches 28 times better than wolves. 
Eating a plant-based diet, include elimination of allergic reactions, improved skin and hair, better oral hygiene and weight management. 

A fun fact: In the Guinness Book of World Records, the oldest dog, Bramble - the collie, is a vegan dog. 

Fortunately, like us, we have the technology to keep our dogs, full, happy and healthy in a vegan plant-based diet.  
They don’t need to participate in taking other animal’s lives when they don’t have to.  
With very few exceptions, dogs will thrive on a vegan diet!
