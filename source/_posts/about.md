Hello, friends!  

We are the family behind The Vegan Guide . Me.  
Cintia and Tiago, animals lovers and mommy and daddy of Sherlock, a dog that teaches us everyday what is love and reinforces that every animal is special in tons of ways.  
This vegan guide was designed and coded by us, our way to help saving animals lives through sharing knowledge, tips and guiding the vegan shopping experience.  
Being vegan is not as difficult as it appears to be. We want to help you with that.  
You will find articles about brands, products, services and much more.  

Veganism is about love, and we shouldn’t be afraid to talk about it. 
Let’s share experience and fight for the ones that can can’t fight alone.
