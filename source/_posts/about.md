Hello, friends!  

We are the family behind VeganGuide.Me.  

[Cintia](http://cintiaromero.com) and [Tiago](http://tiagorg.com), animal lovers, and mommy and daddy of Sherlock, a wonderful dog that teaches us everyday what love is and reinforces that every animal is special in tons of ways.  

This vegan guide was designed and coded by us, our way to help saving animals lives through sharing knowledge, tips and guiding your vegan shopping experience, featuring a blazing-fast search bar.  

Being vegan is not as difficult as it appears to be. We want to help you with that.  

Here you will find articles about vegan brands, products, ingredients, services and much more.  

Veganism is about love, and we shouldn’t be afraid to talk about it. 

Let’s share experience and fight for the ones that can can’t fight alone.

NOTE: at this moment, this site is still being built. The coding is all done, we're now working on the content. If you would like to help us out, we would really appreciate it. In that case, get in touch with us on [veganguideme@gmail.com](mailto:veganguideme@gmail.com)
