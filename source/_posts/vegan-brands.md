## Why support vegan brands?

It’s simple and it proves that consumers do value a vegan brand and it shows to the world that vegan is sustainable and profitable. Being vegan is being kind to the animals, to the planet and to ourselves.
We are always searching for vegan and cruelty-free alternatives while shopping, specially when we are a newbie in this lovely life style. 

We did this research for you and for yourselves.
Below, you will find a alphabetic list divided in 3 sections:

1. 100% vegan brands
1. Cruelty-free brands
1. Recommended lists from other websites we trust

These brands deserve recognition, they are against cruelty and fighting for a better world for all of us.
We hope with this list, you’ll be able to make your vegan life style easier. Let’s support these awesome brands, growing the love and spreading kindness. 

And remember, you can identify a vegan or cruelty-free brand by the (V symbol) / (cruelty-free symbol) printed in the label/package of the product. They should show it. 

*Please note: These listed brands were researched and some of them experienced by us. Let us know if you have any update or some brand we missed here. Vegan Guide is all about sharing experiences.
